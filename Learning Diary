LEARNING DIARY, MOBILE MODULE

June 11:
I read the course materials and installed Android Studio.
Watched a video and learned what the development environment looks like, how to use the layout editor and constraints (how to set anchors).
Learned how to add a text field and a button and how to run the application.
Created a simple app that adds two numbers and displays the result.
I also learned the basics of debugging in Android Studio.

June 18:
I watched another video and learned what an Intent is and how to move to another screen (Activity).
Used onClick to trigger an event.
Built a small app where you can press a button to open the Google website.

June 25:
Studied how to use ListView, how to add and scale images properly.
Learned how to retrieve data from strings.xml (string-array), and use an Adapter to display this data in a list.

June 26:
I started building my own application.
I used three example videos as a base, but I wanted to develop and improve the idea.
Added a counter to the shopping cart, the ability to add selected products, and the ability to remove items from the cart.
I created Cart and CartActivity classes:
•	Cart class handles all calculations and stores product quantities.
•	CartActivity is responsible for displaying the cart and the total price.
I also created a Product class with equals() and hashCode() overrides so that items can be compared and stored correctly in a HashMap.
The list of items is stored using an ArrayList.

June 29:
The development process faced some challenges, such as app crashes, but debugging helped identify and resolve the issues.
One problem was with item price types:
Prices were stored as strings, but needed to be converted to double for calculations and rounding.
I used Double.parseDouble() to fix this issue.

July 3:
I added Toast notifications when an item is added ("Item added") in DetailActivity class.
I also implemented the decreaseItem() function and a confirmation alert in the cart when a user removes items.
This made the cart more interactive and complete.

July 5:
I made final UI and layout changes:
•	Set a new background color using colors.xml.
•	Added an ImageButton for the shopping cart.
•	Adjusted fonts and element placement.
•	I styled buttons by changing the corner radius and added custom colors.
•	I downloaded and added product images for each item.
•	I changed item names to match the coffee shop theme (e.g., Latte, Espresso).
•	I also added "Back" buttons to return from CartActivity and DetailActivity to the main screen.
